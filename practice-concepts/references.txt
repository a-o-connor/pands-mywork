https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide/ = objecct oriented approach to using matplotlib

- Link to article on [Real Python: Python Plotting With Matplotlib Guide](https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide/) to get familiar with the objecct oriented approach to using matplotlib
- [Tutorial on Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/barchart.html#sphx-glr-gallery-lines-bars-and-markers-barchart-py) was followed to generate the bar chart, with the mean of each numeric attribute by species 

For Running these in the notebook: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_modules.asp https://realpython.com/python-modules-packages/

Explore the correlations in the numeric data using Pandas ````.corr```` returns a correlation matrix of numeric columns. ([W3 Schools.](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_correlations.asp))

Necessary to have a numeric data frame first: Reference: Also W3 Schools! (https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/ref_df_select_dtypes.asp)
- .corr returns a PD data frame that can be indexed using .loc (https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_dataframes.asp)

- split-apply-combine
- Split a table into groups.
- Apply some operations to each of those smaller tables.
- Combine the results
- Filter methods come back to you with a subset of the original DataFrame. This most commonly means using .filter() to drop entire groups based on some comparative statistic about that group and its sub-table. It also makes sense to include under this definition a number of methods that exclude particular rows from each group
